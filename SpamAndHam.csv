White people after seeing Raheem Sterling's IG post & seeing that black people are portrayed in a negative light in the media,0
"With all due respect, Henry. Did we really need @sterling7 to say all those things? If we needed his message as a wake up call is because we were more deaf and blind than I thought. Some of the coverage has been racist. And it fit the racist agenda of not all but some audience",0
"Racism has no place in society, let alone football. What is wrong with people who think it’s acceptable to think this way let alone appear comfortable to hurl racial slurs in public? Whether the guy at Chelsea last night is proved guilty or not, we got to look at ourselves.",0
We’ve received reports from a variety of sources about an incident of alleged racist abuse at the Chelsea-Manchester City game. We will forward those to Chelsea and offer our support in their investigation. ,0

"So I’ve played well over ten hours of Fallout 76 solo over past few weeks on Xbox. Personally I think it’s great. Lonely, but absolutely playable solo. Latest beta build today fixes many prior issues.",0
"a Grammy nomination with screaming, blast beats, solos, dual melodies, and a ton of key changes? This will be a statement if it wins.",0
I need to apologize. Because of the long wait from when your album was announced to when it actually came out (it felt like an eternity) it ended up totally slipping my mind that it even came out. I have immediately rectified the situation and will listen now!,0
"Shout out to our good mate @AndyJamesGuitar for coming down to the Luxembourg show last night! If you're still around he's got a guitar clinic there today, don't miss it!",0
"Got it :) Still wish you'd won some music awards so that more people throughout the world would learn 'bout your music. You're really Genius and your albums ""Exodus"" and ""Arrival"" are pure musical beauty. I was crying when I was listening to ""Exit Through Ashes"" for the 1st time.",0
"Arrival is such a kickass album. This deserves to blow up. Pure Gold from the man. From scintillating covers to smashing such good stuff, long way. You deserve all the praise.",0
I’ve bought something about 30 picks. I like them. I’ve been using 1mm picks for a long time. First time when I tried Andy’s pick it was a little bit strange feeling but it had been about for several minutes... after that I really liked them and they are my favorite picks now.,0
